The following query can be used to delete all the rows without deleting the table:

DELETE FROM table_name
If you want to delete only selected rows, you can use this template:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE logical_expression

To use the module, you must first create a Connection object that represents the database. Here the data will be stored in the example.s3db file:

import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.s3db')
Once you have a Connection, you can create a Cursor object and call its execute() method to perform SQL queries:

cur = conn.cursor()
 
# Executes some SQL query
cur.execute('SOME SQL QUERY')
 
# After doing some changes in DB don't forget to commit them!
cur.commit()
To get data returned by SELECT query you can user fetchone(), fetchall() methods:

cur.execute('SOME SELECT QUERY')
 
# Returns the first row from the response
cur.fetchone()
 
# Returns all rows from the response
cur.fetchall()
